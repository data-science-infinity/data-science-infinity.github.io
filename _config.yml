description: "I hold a UK MSc in Statistical Data Science and a BA in Psychology. Since 2022, I have been continuously training to become a data analyst, honing my expertise in this field. I love solving problems using data andenjoy expressing my creativity by designing presentations and dashboards.
In my 3-year tenure as abehavioral therapist, I developed valuable soft skills for data roles, including effective communication toexplain technical concepts to non-technical audiences and collaborate with diverse teams, adaptability for changing project requirements, and effective collaboration fostering a positive work environment. I have a UK settled status and available for immediate start. I hold a full UK driving licence and have my own transport."
