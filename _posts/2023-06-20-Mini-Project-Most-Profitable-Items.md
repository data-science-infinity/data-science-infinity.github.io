Because of the need to significantly increase inventory of the most profitable clothing items for the next seasons, I created a PowerBI dashboard and made recommendations based on my analysis as requested by the head of data and insights.

#### SUMMARY
##### Conclusions: 
Most profitable clothing items of all times are Women's Tights, small and large size. Men's Sports Shorts, medium size, Men's Bib-Shorts, medium size
##### Challenges: 
The only challenge I had was time, I had only one day to finish this mini project.
##### Techniques used: 
I used Power BI to calculate the profit.
#### Data
The data was provided by the head of data.

#### CALCULATING PROFIT USING POWER BI
•	I used Power BI to create a Profit variable using the following formula \
•	Profit = Squiddle_Sales[Quantity]*Squiddle_Sales[ProductPrice]-Squiddle_Sales[Quantity]*Squiddle_Sales[ProductCost]
