Because of the need to significantly increase inventory of the most profitable clothing items for the next seasons, I created a PowerBI dashboard and made recommendations based on my analysis as requested by the head of data and insights.

The only challenge I had was time, I had only one day to finish this mini project.
#### Techniques used: 
I used Power BI to calculate the profit.
### Data

## CALCULATING PROFIT USING POWER BI
•	I used Power BI to create a Profit variable using the following formula /
•	Profit = Squiddle_Sales[Quantity]*Squiddle_Sales[ProductPrice]-Squiddle_Sales[Quantity]*Squiddle_Sales[ProductCost]
